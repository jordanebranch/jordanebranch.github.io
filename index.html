	<p>I am a product designer at Industry Dive in Washington, DC, while pursuing a Master of Human Computer Interaction at Iowa State University. In my free time, I peruse CodePen, eat under the guise of a food photography hobby and specialize in the UX of nachos. Intro tagline by IDEO, found in Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things."
